# Examples & Boilerplate

If you want to quickly bootstrap a new project using the Amber Design System, you can check out this collection of boilerplate templates & examples.

### Loading from Unpkg
* `amber-visual`
* `amber-components`

This **extremely** minimal example loads the two main modules of the Amber Design System from the [Unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) CDN, without using bundling tools. Useful for in-browser quick tests or editor like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

### Webpack starter project
* `amber-visual`
* `amber-components`
* `webpack` + `webpack-dev-server` + `html-webpack-plugin`
* SASS + `sass-loader`

Local project setup based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as bundling tool & [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) pre-processor for styling.
